Hello, I'm a theif, and I'm here to steal your heart
Your hand looks heavy, can I hold it for you?
Are you the sun? Because you're so beautiful it's blinding me
Do you have a name or I can call you mine?
Was your dad a boxer? Because damn, you're a knockout!
You're so cute it's distracting <3
Do you have a map? I'm getting lost in your eyes
I'm not a hoarder but I really want to keep you forever ;)
If I could rearrange the alphabet, I would put 'U' and 'I' together
Are you a campfire? Cause you're hot and I'm going to want s'more
If you were a potato, you'd be a really nice potato
Excuse me, but I think I dropped something. MY JAW!
You're definitely on my to-do-list tonight 
Are you sunsets? Because I can watch you for hours <3
Do you play soccer? Because you're a keeper!
I may not be a genie, but I can make your dreams come true ;)
If nothing lasts forever, will you be my nothing?
Are you my phone charger? because without you, I'd die
I'd say god bless you, but it looks like he already did ;)
